    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Before we tell you how to make Francesinha at your home, let's have a quick
        overview of this traditional Portuguese meal. Francesinha is a mixed sandwich 
        that is made with a layer of bread, a steak, two different sausages, cheese, 
        ham, bread, cover the sandwich with cheese, then melt all the cheese, egg on 
        the top, fries on the side, and everything covered with a hot sauce (a little 
        bit spicy without being too spicy).

    <p>
        Known as Little French or Frenchie, we have to be honest with you: the only 
        thing little about Francesinha is the name. As with most food items in Porto, 
        it is difficult to select just one as the best francesinha in the city. Each 
        restaurant in Porto has its own recipe and most of them argue that the secret 
        is in the sauce. Is it? Opinions diverge. Some argue that the secret of 
        Francesinha is the quality of the products. In our opinion, both are correct. 
        That being said, here's how to make Francesinha like a local.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices/pp Loaf Bread (thick cut)</li>
        <li>1 Linguica/pp</li>
        <li>1 Sausage/pp (salsicha fresca)</li>
        <li>2 slices/pp Ham (sliced thin)</li>
        <li>2 slices/pp Baloney (sliced thin)</li>
        <li>1 steak/pp Rump steak (cut thin)</li>
        <li>5-6 slices/pp Flamengo cheese slices</li>
        <li>1 Egg/pp (optional)</li>
        <li>130 g/pp Fries (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slightly toast the bread in the oven or in the toaster but without 
            smooshing it, so it doesn't lose its thickness.</li>
        <li>Cook the steak medium/rare and allow it to rest away from the heat for a 
            few minutes, to retain the juices. Slit it slightly so that it's easier to 
            cut later on.</li>
        <li>Cut the linguica and the Italian sausage length wise and trim them, if 
            necessary, to match the size of the bread. Cook them in the same pan as 
            the steak.</li>
        <li>Fry the egg(s) in the same pan again (optional). Fry the potatoes on the 
            side (opcional).</li>
        <li>Assembling: after toasted, place one slice of bread in a deep dish that 
            can go in the oven, and lay the slices of ham and baloney over the bread; 
            place the sausage and the linguica interspersed, side by side, and then the 
            steak; place the second slice of bread on top and cover it all with cheese 
            slices. </li>  
        <li>Turn on the broil and place it in the oven until the cheese has 
            melted.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, (place the egg on top), pour at least two ladles of 
            sauce over the francesinha and serve immediatly.</li>
        <li>Pour the rest of the sauce in a gravy boat and serve seperately (as well 
            as the fries).</li>
    </ol>
